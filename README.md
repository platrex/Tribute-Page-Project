HTML Structure:
I structured the webpage using basic HTML. I used appropriate heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to represent the title and sections. The timeline is presented as a list of significant events in McCarthyâ€™s life, using <ul> and <li> elements for readability.

CSS for Styling:
I styled the page using CSS to ensure a clean, modern look. The page is centered, with a border around the timeline section. I applied specific font styles for headings and body text, making sure the content was easy to read. The portrait image of John McCarthy is also styled to align well with the text.

Image Integration:
I included a grayscale image of John McCarthy to give the page a personal touch. The image was added using the <img> tag and styled to fit the layout.

Responsive Design:
I made the webpage responsive, ensuring it works well across different screen sizes using media queries. This allows users on various devices to have an optimal viewing experience.

Footer Section:
I added a footer with credits to the image source and copyright information, giving proper attribution while keeping the design clean and professional.
